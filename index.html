      The Buffalo Green Code Unified Development Ordinance Becomes Effective Citywide.
    </p>
    <p>With the Unified Development Ordinance now effective citywide, April 3, 2017 marks the culmination of a nearly
      seven-year effort that involved thousands of community members in neighborhoods throughout our city. Since Mayor
      Byron W. Brown initially announced the Buffalo Green Code, on Earth Day of 2010, the effort has been a
      community-driven process aimed at ensuring the Green Code reflects the values of our residents. Thank you to all
      of you who have dedicated so much of your time and passion during this historic initiative!</p>
