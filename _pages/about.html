      This is a project submitted to the Buffalo Civic Innovation Challenge!
    </p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly, searchable Green Code for people who rely on the Green
      Code as a resource. Whether you are a developer, a politician, or a concerned citizen, I hope you are able to make
      use of this project.</p>
    <p>This digital Green Code will continue to evolve and get better especially with your continued use and feedback.
