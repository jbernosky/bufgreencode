Corner visibility must be provided along all public rights-of-way, except for passages and alleys, in the N-2R, N-3R, N-4-30, and N-4-50 zones. Corner visibility is defined as the triangular area formed by projecting the lines of intersecting curbs, or of street paving edges where there are no curbs, and a line joining these points 20 feet from their point of intersection. No structure, including signs and fences, may be erected, and no plant foliage may be maintained, between heights of three and one-half feet and ten feet above the curb level in this area.
