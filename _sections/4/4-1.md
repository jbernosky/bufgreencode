This open space should be framed by building facades where possible and should comply with  the standards of the D-OS and/or D-OG zone. In lieu of site-by-site compliance, property owners of contiguous lots within the same zone may provide this accessible open space on an aggregate basis, so long as the total area of the space is equal to or greater than the combined minimum required area of accessible open space for each individual lot  and the space is within 1,320 feet of sites served.
2. All principal buildings, with the exception of those located more than 200 feet from a public
thoroughfare, must be oriented to the thoroughfares onto which they face, with front and corner facades positioned parallel or radial to adjacent right-of-way lines.
3. The following exterior facade materials are prohibited on principal buildings:
    1. Reflective wall surface material with a Visible Light Reflectance (VLR) of greater than 15%.
